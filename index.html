        <p>Could there be a technologically advanced extraterrestrial society hiding in our Galaxy?. The idea that these spacefaring aliens are simply reluctant to reveal themselves has featured in sci-fi storytelling for many decades, but technically anything is possible considering we don’t have any evidence for ETIs to begin with. Perhaps everyone really is hiding. Maybe there truly is a threat lurking out there, somewhere in the dark. And maybe humanity just hasn’t realized it yet.</p>
